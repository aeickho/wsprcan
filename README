This is a decoder for K1JT's Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.
The decoder is written in C and is a command-line program that takes
a single argument which is the name of the .wav file to process.

It requires only two external libraries: libsndfile and libfftw3

The name, wsprcan, is derived from "WSPR" decoder written in "C" by k9"AN".

The motivation for this project was to learn how to demodulate and decode
wspr signals and to refresh my C programming skills so that I can help my
son learn to program in C.

Features:
The wsprcan program will decode and display signals that are outside of 
the wspr frequency segment by up to 50 Hz on each side. At present,
it does not decode signals using the 6-digit locator. Also, no provision
is made for uploading spots to the WSPRnet database. 

The detection algorithm used in wsprcan is less conservative about 
choosing candidate signals to process. In initial tests, it appears that 
wsprcan may decode more signals than wspr on a crowded band, such as 20m.

The algorithm for finding initial estimates of frequency, drift, and time
shift is almost identical to Joe's.

The algorithm for refining the estimates of frequency, drift, and time shift
is a bit different from Joe's.

The sequential Fano decoder used to decode the message is Phil Karn's fano.c
