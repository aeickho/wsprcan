Fixed a bug that caused slight frequency error (less than 0.5 Hz). Thanks
to Glenn, N6GN for pointing me toward this issue.

Also added one more digit of precision to frequency reports in ALL_WSPR.TXT.
This will be used to study the variability of frequency estimates.

Applied grid6 patch contributed by John, KD6EKQ. This fixes a bug that
caused the displayed 6-digit locator to be corrupted when there were two
or more type 3 messages decoded.

Applied patch file contributed by John, KD6EKQ. This adds the following:

* Added the ability to read and incorporate fftw wisdom to speed up the
DFT transforms when using PCM WAV input files. The code checks for the
"WSPRD_FFTW_WISDOM" environment variable. If set, it specifies the
file with fftw wisdom.

* Relaxed the error checks on PCM WAV input files to allow 24, 32 bit and
float sample formats (libsndfile handles the details of the conversion,
so there is no real reason to exclude such files).

* Added the -e command line option. It enables code that corrects for
transceiver tuning error. The argument is the dial freq error in Hz.
