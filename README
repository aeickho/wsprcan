wsprcan is a "W"eak "S"ignal "P"ropagation "R"eporter 
detector/demodulator/decoder written in "C" by k9"AN"

This is a decoder for K1JT's Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.
The decoder is written in C and is a command-line program that
reads from a .wav file and writes output to the console.

wsprcan requires only two external libraries: libsndfile and libfftw3

COMPILING:
A bare-bones Makefile is included. Change include and lib directories 
and it should just work, provided that the header files and library
files for sndfile and fftw3 are available. Test on OS X 10.8 and 
Ubuntu 12.04.

USAGE:
wsprcan freq file.wav

e.g. 
./wsprcan 14.0971 140709_2258.wav

FEATURES:
The wsprcan program will decode and display signals that are outside of 
the wspr frequency segment by up to 50 Hz on each side. At present,
it does not decode signals using the 6-digit locator. Also, no provision
is made for uploading spots to the WSPRnet database. 

wsprcan was optimized to maximize the number of decodes on a crowded band,
such as 20m or 30m. Initial tests suggest that wsprcan may decode more 
callsigns than wspr or wspr-x under certain conditions. 

The detection, synchronization, and symbol estimation algorithms are all 
based, more-or-less, on K1JT's wspr and wspr-x programs. Based on my 
understanding of how things should work, I prototyped the algorithms 
in gnu octave first, and then translated my octave code to C. 
The symbols are decoded using Phil Karn's sequential decoder routine, 
fano.c.
