Applied patch file contributed by John, KD6EKQ. This adds the following:

* Added the ability to read and incorporate fftw wisdom to speed up the
DFT transforms when using PCM WAV input files. The code checks for the
"WSPRD_FFTW_WISDOM" environment variable. If set, it specifies the
file with fftw wisdom.

* Relaxed the error checks on PCM WAV input files to allow 24, 32 bit and
float sample formats (libsndfile handles the details of the conversion,
so there is no real reason to exclude such files).

* Added the -e command line option. It enables code that corrects for
transceiver tuning error. The argument is the dial freq error in Hz.
