This is a decoder for K1JT's Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.
The decoder is written in C and is a command-line program that takes
a single argument which is the name of the .wav file to process.

It requires only two external libraries: libsndfile and libfftw3

The name, wsprcan, is derived from "WSPR" decoder written in "C" by k9"AN".

The motivation for this project was to learn how to demodulate and decode
wspr signals and to refresh my C programming skills so that I can help my
son learn to program in C.

Compiling:
A bare-bones Makefile is included. Change include and lib directories 
and it should just work, provided that the header files and library
files for sndfile and fftw3 are available. Test on OS X 10.8 and 
Ubuntu 12.04.

Usage:
wsprcan freq file.wav

e.g. 
./wsprcan 14.0971 140709_2258.wav

Features:
The wsprcan program will decode and display signals that are outside of 
the wspr frequency segment by up to 50 Hz on each side. At present,
it does not decode signals using the 6-digit locator. Also, no provision
is made for uploading spots to the WSPRnet database. 

The detection, synchronization, and symbol estimation algorithms are all 
based, more-or-less, on K1JT's wspr and wspr-x programs. Based on my 
understanding of how things should work, I prototyped the algorithms 
in gnu octave first, and then translated by octave code to C. 
The symbols are decoded using Phil Karn's sequential decoder routine, 
fano.c.
