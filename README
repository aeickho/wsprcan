k9an-wspr is a decoder for K1JT's Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.

The program is written in C and is a command-line program that reads from a
.c2 file or .wav file and writes output to the console. It is designed so that
it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the wsprd program that wspr-x uses 
for decoding. 

k9an-wspr requires only two external libraries: libsndfile and libfftw3

COMPILING:
A bare-bones Makefile is included. The program is known to compile on OS X 10.8
with clang and on Ubuntu 12.04 with gcc.

USAGE:
k9an-wspr [-wv] [-f freq] infile

    -w wideband mode prints displays decoded signals within +/- 150 Hz 
    -v verbose
    -f x (x is frequency in MHz)

infile can be either .wav or .c2

e.g. 
./k9an-wspr -wf 14.0956 140709_2258.wav

Note that for .c2 files, the frequency within the file overrides the command
line value.

FEATURES:
By default, k9an-wspr reports signals that are within +/- 105 Hz of the 
subband center frequency. The wideband option (-w) extends this to +/- 150 Hz.

At present, k9an-wspr does not maintain a hashtable, nor does it decode 
signals using the 6-digit locator.

k9an-wspr was optimized to maximize the number of decodes on a crowded band. It 
uses a looser selection criterion than K1JT's program.

The symbols are decoded using Phil Karn's sequential decoder routine,
fano.c.
